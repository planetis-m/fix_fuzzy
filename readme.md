## Translation Assistance Tools
### Fuzzy Message Repair Tool

This Python script helps improve the quality of translated content
by addressing messages marked as "fuzzy" in translation files.
It offers several automated fixes:

1. Intelligent ampersand insertion:

   Adds ampersand characters for keyboard shortcuts, using the target
   language's letter frequencies as a guide.

2. Case adjustment:

   Modifies capitalization to match the source text more closely.

3. Punctuation refinement:

   Performs simple substitutions, such as replacing "..." with "â€¦"
   for improved typography.

By automating these common adjustments, this tool streamlines the
translation review process and enhances overall text consistency.
