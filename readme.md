## Automatically fix fuzzy messages in translations!

This is a Python script that can repair some translation messages that have been marked as fuzzy.
It can add ampersand characters (used for creating keyboard shortcuts) randomly in text using the
target's language letter frequencies as guide. It also can uncapitalize the words and make some
simple substitutions at the end of the message (replacing ... with â€¦, etc)
